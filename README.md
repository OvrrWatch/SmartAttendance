# Problem statement
taking attendance has always been a hectic task and time consuming for the organisers of any event and everytime they end up getting 
proper head count issues and they may face problems regarding arrangement or seats.

# Solution
Smart Attendance does the job for attendance verification of college, school, conferences, seminars etc. Based on their location status either they are in the seminar, conference hall or not. and to initiate a two step verification to be entered in the app, provided by the host of the seminar.
